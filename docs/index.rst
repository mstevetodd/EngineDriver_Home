Supported servers include JMRI, DCC-EX, MRC Prodigy WiFi, Digitrax LnWi, and WifiTrax (for NCE). 
Once connected, you can control your locomotives and your entire model railroad. 
Speed, direction, and up to 29 DCC functions are supported for one to six locomotives or consists. 
You can create and edit consists (software-defined). 
You can also control layout power, turnouts/points, routes, and access JMRI web panels and windows.

See `About <./about/index.html>`_ for more information.

See `Operation <./operation/index.html>`_ for details on how to use Engine Driver.

---------------------
Why Use Engine Driver
---------------------

You can use Engine Driver to operate your DCC model railway without being physically
tethered by any wires. This allows you to walk around your layout, following your trains
and/or position yourself anywhere around your layout (eg, at your favourite viewing
position).

Adding a Engine Driver controller is inexpensive. Instead of an expensive DCC controller, most old Android phones or tablet will work.  You don't need to have a sim card in the phone.

You only need to interact with JMRI and/or your DCC base station directly when setting up or
re-configuring your layout. Once configured, you do not need to operate either JMRI or
your DCC base station directly while you are running your trains.
