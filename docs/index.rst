|JEDT|, more commonly known as |ed|, is a free Android application that connects to a WiThrottleâ„¢ [#WIT]_ Server or `DCC-EX EX-CommandStation <https://dcc-ex.com/>`_ to control model trains.

Supported servers include |JMRI|, |EX-CS|, `MRC Prodigy WiFi <https://www.modelrectifier.com/category-s/332.htm>`_, `Digitrax LnWi <https://www.digitrax.com/products/wireless/lnwi/>`_, and `WifiTrax (for NCE) <http://wifitrax.com/products/product-WFD-30-detail.html>`_. 
Once connected, you can control the speed direction and up to 32 DCC functions of your DCC enabled locomotives (locos). From one to six locos or |locos_consists| can be controlled at the same time.  
You can easily create and edit on-the-fly |consists| (software-defined). 
You can also control layout power, turnouts/points, routes, and access JMRI web panels and windows.

Why Use Engine Driver
---------------------

   :align: left

You can use |ed| to operate your DCC or DC [#DC]_ model train layout without being physically tethered by any wires. This allows you to walk around your layout, following your trains and/or position yourself anywhere around your layout (e.g. at your favourite viewing position).

You can add additional |ed| controllers inexpensively using old Android phones or tablets, instead of proprietary controllers.  (You don't need to have a sim card in the phone.)

You only need to interact with JMRI and/or your |CS| directly when setting up or re-configuring your layout. Once configured, you do not need to interact with either JMRI or your |CS| directly while you are running your trains.

.. [#WIT] 'WiThrottle' is a trademark owned by Brett Hoffman. It is also an `iOS app <https://www.withrottle.com/html/home.html>`_ developed by Brett Hoffman which has similar capabilities to |ed|. |BR|\ The 'WiThrottle protocol' is a communications protocol developed by Brett Hoffman.  It is used by JMRI, |ed|, the wiThrottle app and a number of other apps and |CSs|. |BR|\ References in this website to a '|WTS|', refer to a server that can communicate using the 'WiThrottle protocol'.
 
.. [#DC] The |EX-CS| is capable of driving DC Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) outputs as well as, or instead of, DCC outputs.  |ED| is therefor capable of running DC locos as easily as it does DCC locos.
