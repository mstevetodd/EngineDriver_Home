Notes:

* The number is brackets after the Throttle Screen Layout name is the number of throttles that the layout can support.
* The 'Simple' Throttle Screen Layout is designed to allow for up to 6 throttles simultaneously.  |br|\ It is recommended that this only be used on a tablet device, because of the screen real estate demands that 6 throttles requires. |br|\ When this Throttle Screen Layout is selected, the ``Number of Throttles`` preferences options is activated.  You can then use this to restrict the number of throttles being displayed on the 'Simple' Throttle Screen Layout.  |br|\ Also the ``Functions Area Size`` preferences options is activated.  You can then use this to control how many Function Buttons are displayed with each throttle.  By default, not Function buttons will be shown. |br|\ If you have selected In Phone Loco Sounds, then you will want to set this to 4 (for Mute, Light, Bell and Whistle/Horn).

**Engine Driver** automatically reload the throttle screen after closing the preferences screen.

Consist Function Follow Preferences
-----------------------------------

|todo|

Options for how functions will behave in a consist.

Consist Functions - Follow Rule Style
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

|todo|

Which style of rules to follow in a consist when function buttons are pressed.

Note: If 'Use Default function labels' is enabled, 'Special...' will also apply to the lead (or only) loco.


You can now arrange the labels on ED any way you want, and as long as the equivalent function has a similar name it doesn't matter what function number it is, it will activate it correctly.

I have added two new options to the menu " Special Exact" and "Special Partial"
These options override the Original and Complex options completely and ignore the string matching preferences (it disables them)

Their behaviour is:

* for every loco in the consist
  
  * for every function in the locos roster entries

    * if the string of the function label exactly matches (or partially matches) the label of the function the ED is currently showing for the pressed function button

      * the function will be activated on that loco
  
Note

* There is no lead trail checking.  any matching function will be activated in any loco
* If no matching function on a particular loco (including the lead) nothing will happen for that loco
* It will use the ED default function labels if you have set them
* OR whatever labels have been loaded for the lead loco.
* Partial patching is a bit so-so.  I have a couple of sound decoders that allow me to change the bell and whistle tones in the function buttons.  Those functions also get activated when I just press 'Bell' or 'Whistle' as that text was also in the labels for the functions..
