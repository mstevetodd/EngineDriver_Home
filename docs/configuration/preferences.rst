Localisation
""""""""""""

Changing the *Localisation* primarily changes the language used in the menus, buttons and messages throughout |ED|.

For English, it also changes the railroad/railway terminology (eg, Selecting 'Use Phone's global setting' and having this set to 'English (Australia)' or 'English (UK)' results in the term 'Points' to be displayed rather than 'Turnouts' as is displayed when 'English (US)' is selected). In the Preferences screen and the Throttle Screen Layout selection screen (where 'shunting' is displayed rather than 'switching').  This is not guaranteed to operate on all text on all screens. 

Supported localisations are:

* Use Phone's global setting |br| -  Will use any of the localisations below depending on what your system is set to it
* English (US) |br| - Engine Driver's default
* Italian
* Portuguese
* German
* Spanish
* Catalan
* French
* Czech

The following can't be chosen in the preference, but will be activated automatically if you select ``Use the Phone's global setting`` and you have selected one of the following primary languages in you Device's / Phone's global settings:

* English (UK)
* English (AUS)
* English (NZ)

Notes:

* The number is brackets after the Throttle Screen Layout name is the number of throttles that the layout can support.
* The 'Simple' Throttle Screen Layout is designed to allow for up to 6 throttles simultaneously.  |br|\ It is recommended that this be used on a tablet device, because of the screen real estate demands that 6 throttles requires. |br|\ When this Throttle Screen Layout is selected, the `Number of Throttles`_ preferences options is activated.  You can then use this to restrict the number of throttles being displayed on the 'Simple' Throttle Screen Layout.  |br|\ Also the `Function Buttons Area size`_ preferences options is activated.  You can then use this to control how many Function Buttons are displayed with each throttle.  By default, no Function buttons will be shown. |br|\ If you have selected In Phone Loco Sounds, then you may want to set this to three or four (for Mute, Bell and Whistle/Horn, Short Horn/whistle).

|ed| will automatically reload the throttle screen after closing the preferences screen.

Throttle Control Preferences
----------------------------

The following preferences provide options for how the throttle on the Throttle Screen will behave.

Speed Units
"""""""""""

Use this preference to change how the speed is displayed and functions on all the throttles on the Throttle Screen.

Options:

 * Percent 0 - 100%
 * Auto Speed steps
 * 8 steps
 * 10 steps
 * 14 steps
 * 28 steps
 * 128 steps

Note that the `Speed button Change Amount`_ preference will work in the units that you choose here.

Maximum throttle Percentage
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This preference allows you to set the maximum allowed throttle slider value in % on all the throttles on the Throttle Screen.

Maximum throttle Change
"""""""""""""""""""""""

This preference allows you to set the Maximum allowed throttle change in % on all the throttles on the Throttle Screen.  

|todo| *Can't remember when this is used.*

Speed button Change Amount
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This preference allows you to set how much the Speed buttons jump/change the speed.

Note that this works in the units chosen in the `Speed Units` preference.i.e. If your Speed Units are '8 Steps' and your Speed button change amount is '4' then just two click will get you from zero to 100% speed.

Speed button Repeat Delay
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Use this preference to change how long between repeats on speed buttons. Smaller is faster. Excludes gamepad buttons. 

Note that this is independent of the equivalent gamepad preference. (`Speed button Repeat Delay (gamepad)`_)

Speed step on Decrement?
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Use this preference to force the `Speed button Change Amount`_ to be used when long pressing a lower speed on the slider. If not enabled, the speed will immediately jump to the touched speed.

Stop on Phone call?
"""""""""""""""""""

If the preference is enabled, |ed| will stop all loco(s) controlled by the device /phone when a phone call is answered or placed.

Direction change while moving?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If the preference is enabled, |ed| will allow you to change the direction of the locos controlled by a throttle to instantly change direction.  i.e. Both directions buttons are allows available.

Stop on direction change?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

If the preference is enabled, |ed| will stop the locos controlled by a throttle if you click the opposite direction while the loco(s) are moving.  Effectively this means that the 'opposite' direction will (also) act like a stop button.

'Limit Speed' & 'Pause' button Preferences
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

These preferences allow for additional buttons to appear in the Function Button area of each Throttle on the Throttle Screen, but are not related to DCC Functions.

Show 'Limit Speed' button?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If this preference is enabled, |ed| will show a :guilabel:`Limit Speed` button in all the throttles in the Throttle Screen. 

When clicked, |ED| will temporarily restrict the maximum speed on the individual throttle.  The speed tat it limits to is set with the `'Limit Speed' button`_ preference.

'Limit Speed' button
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Use this preference to set the amount, as a percentage (\%), of the throttle that the speed will be temporarily limited to when you click the :guilabel:`Limit Speed` button. 

Note: If the `Show 'Limit Speed' button?`_ preference is not enabled this has no effect.

Show 'Pause' button?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If this preference is enabled, |ed| will show a :guilabel:`Pause` button in all the throttles in the Throttle Screen. 

When clicked, |ED| will gradually slow and stop the loco(s) of a throttle. When pressed again |ED| will return the loco(s) to original speed.

'Pause' button Rate
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Use this preference to set the number of milliseconds between speed step changes for the Pause action.

Only relevant is the `Show 'Pause' button?`_ preference is enabled.

'Pause' button Step
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Use this preference to set amount, as a percentage (\%), of the throttle that the speed will change by (step) each time after the ``Pause`` is clicked.

Only relevant is the `Show 'Pause' button?`_ preference is enabled.

Consist Function Follow Preferences
-----------------------------------

These preferences allow for change the way DCC functions will behave in a consist.

Consist Functions - Follow Rule Style
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

|todo|

Which style of rules to follow in a consist when function buttons are pressed.

Note: If 'Use Default function labels' is enabled, 'Special...' will also apply to the lead (or only) loco.


You can now arrange the labels on ED any way you want, and as long as the equivalent function has a similar name it doesn't matter what function number it is, it will activate it correctly.

I have added two new options to the menu " Special Exact" and "Special Partial"
These options override the Original and Complex options completely and ignore the string matching preferences (it disables them)

Their behaviour is:

* for every loco in the consist
  
  * for every function in the locos roster entries

    * if the string of the function label exactly matches (or partially matches) the label of the function the ED is currently showing for the pressed function button

      * the function will be activated on that loco
  
Note

* There is no lead trail checking.  any matching function will be activated in any loco
* If no matching function on a particular loco (including the lead) nothing will happen for that loco
* It will use the ED default function labels if you have set them
* OR whatever labels have been loaded for the lead loco.
* Partial patching is a bit so-so.  I have a couple of sound decoders that allow me to change the bell and whistle tones in the function buttons.  Those functions also get activated when I just press 'Bell' or 'Whistle' as that text was also in the labels for the functions..  




Selective Lead Unit Sound?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

|todo|

Send Horn/Bell functions to only the Lead unit in an EngineDriver consist. 

(Only/any function with a 'label' that includes 'bell', 'horn' or 'whistle' as part of the label.)
