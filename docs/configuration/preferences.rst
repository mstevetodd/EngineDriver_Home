Throttle Name
"""""""""""""

Use this to enter a unique name for your device/phone.  The name will appear in the WiThrottle window in JMRI.  

While not significant on a single user layout, having a name on the device can be useful in club or multi user environments, especially when trying to sort out issues.
  
Screen orientation
""""""""""""""""""

There are four options to choose from:

* Portrait
* Landscape
* Auto-Rotate
* Auto-Web

Localisation
""""""""""""

Changing the *Localisation* primarily changes the language used in the menus, buttons and messages throughout |ED|.

For English, it also changes the railroad/railway terminology (e.g. Selecting 'Use Phone's global setting' and having the device/phone set to 'English (Australia)' or 'English (UK)' results in the term 'Points' to be displayed rather than 'Turnouts' which is displayed when 'English (US)' is selected). And in the |P-S| and the Throttle Screen Layout selection preference (where 'shunting' is displayed rather than 'switching').  This is not guaranteed to operate on all text on all screens. 

Supported localisations are:

* Use Phone's global setting |BR| -  Will use any of the localisations below depending on what your system is set to it
* English (US) - Engine Driver's default
* English (UK)
* English (AUS)
* English (NZ)
* Italian
* Portuguese
* German
* Spanish
* Catalan
* French (FR)
* French (FA)
* Czech
* Japanese

Notes:

* The number is brackets after the Throttle Screen Layout name is the number of throttles that the layout can support.
* The 'Simple' Throttle Screen Layout is designed to allow for up to 6 throttles simultaneously.  |BR|\ It is recommended that this be used on a tablet device, because of the screen real estate demands that 6 throttles requires. |BR|\ When this Throttle Screen Layout is selected, the `Number of Throttles`_ preferences options is activated.  You can then use this to restrict the number of throttles being displayed on the 'Simple' Throttle Screen Layout.  |BR|\ Also the `Function Buttons Area size`_ preferences options is activated.  You can then use this to control how many Function Buttons are displayed with each throttle.  By default, no Function buttons will be shown. |BR|\ If you have selected In Phone Loco Sounds, then you may want to set this to three or four (for Mute, Bell and Whistle/Horn, Short Horn/whistle).

|ed| will automatically reload the |T-S| after closing the preferences screen.

  Using this option will cause the image to be:
  
  * proportionally reduced in size in too big to fit the screen, such that the image fills the screen in at least one dimension
  * proportionally increased in size in too small to fill the screen, such that the image fills the screen in at least one dimension

  **Fill - Crop one edge pair**

  Using this option will cause the image to be:
  
  * proportionally reduced in size in too big to fit the screen, such that the image will be cropped on either the top/bottom or the sides, so that the image fills the screen 
  * proportionally increased in size in too small to fill the screen, such that the image will be cropped on either the top/bottom or the sides, so that the image fills the screen

  **Center - No scaling**

  Using this option will cause the image to be centered on the screen.  It will not be either shrunk or expanded.

  **Fit - Shrink only**

  Using this option will cause the image to be proportionally reduced in size in too big to fit the screen, such that the image fills the screen in at least one dimension.  If it to smaller than the screen in both dimensions it will not be resized.

  **Fill - Distort if needed**

  Using this option will cause the image to be forcibly:

  * reduced in size in too big to fit the screen, distorting the image if needed to fill the entire screen in both dimensions
  * increased in size in too small to fill the screen, distorting the image if needed to fill the entire screen in both dimensions

Semi-Realistic Throttle Preferences
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Refer to :ref:`operation/semi-realistic-throttle:preference settings for the srt` for information on the |SRT|.

Acceleration Speed Step Repeat Delay
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This preference adjusts how long between acceleration speed steps repeats (in milliseconds). 

Smaller is faster.

* This setting (combined with the Speed Step Amount) is used to provide a basic level of |SRT| create momentum to loco movement. 
* Think of it providing a smoothing function to the speed control (given that the Load settings will be the primary means of determining major impacts on train performance)
* The default settings provide a moderate momentum.
* To effectively turn off this basic |SRT| momentum (and rely entirely on the decoder momentum), 

   * set the delay time to 100, 
   * step amount to 40.

Deceleration Speed Step Repeat Delay
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This preference adjusts how long between deceleration speed steps repeats (in milliseconds). 

Smaller is faster.

.. note:: 
  :class: note-ed-hidden-title

  See description of the |SRT| throttle and speed changes on the :doc:`/operation/semi-realistic-throttle` page.

Speed Step Amount
'''''''''''''''''

This preference adjusts how much the actual speed step jumps each step to the target speed. 

Larger is faster.

.. note:: 
  :class: note-ed-hidden-title

  See description of the |SRT| throttle and speed changes on the :doc:`/operation/semi-realistic-throttle` page.

Maximum Throttle Percentage (SRT)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This preference adjusts the maximum allowed slider value in % in **ALL** throttle sliders in **ALL** |T-S| types.

.. note:: 
  :class: note-ed-hidden-title

  See description of the |SRT| throttle and speed changes on the :doc:`/operation/semi-realistic-throttle` page.

Throttle Notches
''''''''''''''''

This preference adjusts how the Throttle slider is displayed. Either as a percentage, or by a specific number of steps/notches*

.. note:: 
  :class: note-ed-hidden-title

  See description of the |SRT| throttle and speed changes on the :doc:`/operation/semi-realistic-throttle` page.

Stop Button Action
''''''''''''''''''

This preference adjusts what the :guilabel:`Stop` button does.

Options are:

* Throttle to Zero

   * Has the same effect as selecting step zero on the throttle slider.
   * The commanded speed to the decoder will decrease slowly to zero based on the basic momentum setting of the |SRT|, the |SRT| Load setting and the |SRT| brake setting.
   * In other words, in this case Stop brings the loco to a stop under full control of the |SRT| features.

* Throttle to Zero + Full Brake

   * As above with the addition that the |SRT| Brake goes to its maximum setting (as defined in the Maximum Brake Percentage preference).

* Speed to Zero

   * The commanded speed to the decoder goes to zero.
   * In effect this overrides the |SRT| basic momentum settings, the |SRT| Load setting and the |SRT| Brake setting if the Decoder Brake Type option is NOT active.
   * The loco will decelerate based on the decoder momentum (i.e. CV4) and any decoder functions set up in the Decoder Brake Levels option will be activated depending on the position of the Brake.

* Speed to Zero + Brake to Zero

   * The commanded speed to the decoder goes to zero and the |SRT| Brake goes to zero.
   * The loco will decelerate based on the decoder momentum (and any other decoder functions activated by the operator).

These stop options allow the user to control the deceleration of their train in a variety of ways when using braking. The user can choose to use the |SRT| momentum and braking, or choose to use the decoder momentum and braking. The advantage of the later approach for some users will be that the sound production of a sound decoder that is determined by the momentum/speed in the decoder is fully preserved.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""

If this preference is enabled, the 'system names' for the Routes are not shown in the Routes List.  This is a cosmetic change only and can be used to save space on 'Route list'.

Location Delimiter
""""""""""""""""""

The 'Turnout/Points List' and the 'Routes List' can be filtered.  The filtering relies on the idea that the first part of every Turnout/Point name and every Route name is a 'Location', followed by a common separator, then the actual name for the Turnout/Point or Route name.  The 'filter' then allows you to select one of those locations and |ed| can just show the Turnout/Points or Routes at the 'Location'.

This preference allows you to set the character that marks the end of the Location portion of Turnout/Point and Route names.  By default it is a colon (":") but any character can be used.

Hide if no user name?

.. note:: 
  :class: note-ed-hidden-title

  You can transfer the preferences to a different phone by copying the file. See the :doc:`Moving to a New Device/Phone <../configuration/new_device>` page for more information.


Auto import from all Servers?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

|ed| is able to automatically import a preference file from a |WTS-DCC-EX| if it exists.

If this preference is enabled |ed| will automatically import the preferences from all servers (if they exists) on connection.  i.e. If the file ``<jmri railroad base folder>/prefs/engine_driver/auto_preferences.ed`` is on the server and if it is more recent that the last time checked.

Include recent loco list?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

If this preference is enabled |ed| will include the locos in the recent loco list in `Imports` and `Exports`.

Auto host specific import/export?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You can set up different preferences for different server/railroads and have them automatically load when you connect to that |WTS-DCC-EX|.
The most common use of this (so far) is to remember the locos relevant to that railroad.  e.g. I run N scale and HO Scale.  When I connect to one of the N Scale layouts I use it shows me my N Scale locos in the recent locos list, but when I connect to one of the HO layouts I use, it shows me the my recently used HO locos.

Enable this preference if you wish, on every connection to a host, to AUTOMATICALLY 'Import' preferences for that host, and optionally 'Export' them on disconnect. 

Options:

* None
* Auto import/export on connect/disconnect
* Auto import on connect only

When enabled:

* on connection to a |WTS-DCC-EX|, |ed| will save a file to the  ``/Android/data/jmri.enginedriver/files/`` folder in a file named ``<witServer Name>.ed``.

**IMPORTANT!**

* To constantly reset back to a known state, set to ``Auto import on connect only`` only **after** the first time you have connected to that server and exited |ed|, or after a `Manual host specific export <Manual host specific import/export>`_.


Manual host specific import/export
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. todo:: Manual host specific import/export

'Import' or 'Export' your preferences for a specific host to the  ``/Android/data/jmri.enginedriver/files/`` folder. The host must be in your recent connection list.

Note: this preference is only available when not currently connected to a |WTS-DCC-EX|.  i.e. On the |C-S|.

**WARNINGS:**

* The action will occur IMMEDIATELY on selecting the option and confirming the dialog.


Show Timestamps on Log?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

If this preference is enabled |ed| will show Date Time for each entry on the *Log Screen*.
