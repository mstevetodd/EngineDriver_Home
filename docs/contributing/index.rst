The steps listed here provide guidance on how to make and preview complex changes.

* You need to have an appropriate text editor and Git installed on your machine. For Windows we recommend the free Visual Studio Code IDE (VSC) and GitHub Desktop.
* Install a current version of Python 3 (which also installs pip). The Microsoft Store contains Python published by the Python Software Foundation for Windows. Then use pip to install the required packages pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme sphinxcontrib-spelling.
* On Githib, clone the EngineDriver_Home repository. (See Cloning a repository in GitHub) 
* Using Github Desktop, clone you repository to your local machine.
* Edit the files in the EngineDriver_Home/docs folder. Save, then check and preview your changes by running 'make github' from the root of the dcc-ex.github.io folder. This must be done from cmd.exe in Windows, not PowerShell. If any warnings are reported, fix these and run make github again. Then go to your local directory EngineDriver_Home/docs/_build/html and open index.html in Chrome or another browser.
* Use Github Desktop to commit and then push your changes.
* Go to GitHub and issue a pull request for your branch to be pulled into the main branch. Once itâ€™s merged in by one of the admins, your changes will go live!
