|ed| is highly configurable.

Most configuration options are found in the *Preferences* which is accessed via the overflow menu which is normally three dots (⁞) or three bars (≡).

Some of the many Preferences include:

* You can turn off the `stop on release <./preferences.html#stop-on-release>`_ preference
* You can set a Maximum value and Maximum change% for the throttle sliders
* If the throttle slider is too small for your fingers, increase the size
* You can set the initial web page for the full-size web panel, or enable the smaller web view on the |T-S|
* There are also settings to help maximize the use of your device's smaller screen by hiding items not relevant to you

Look around in Preferences, there are a huge number of settings to personalize |ed|, including many more if you enable `Show Advanced Preferences <./preferences:show advanced preferences>` preference.

   See the :doc:`Preferences <./preferences>` page for a full list of the available preferences.

The *Functions buttons* are changed via the ``Function Buttons`` menu option: :menuselection:`Menu --> Functions Buttons`

Some of the Function button preferences include:

* You can set the default labels and function numbers to display. 
* If you have entered labels for a roster entry in JMRI, these labels will be used for that entry, and can be copied from the dialog (access the menu after selecting a loco). 
* You can remove buttons by blanking out the labels.
