Configuring Engine Driver

**Engine Driver** is highly configurable.

Most configuration options are found in the *Preferences* which is accessed via the overflow menu which is normally three dots (⁞) or three bars (≡).

Some of the many Preferences include:

* You can turn off the ``stop on release`` preference
* You can set a Maximum value and Maximum change% for the throttle sliders. 
* If the throttle slider is too small for your fingers, increase the size. 
* You can set the initial web page for the full-size web panel, or enable the smaller web view on the throttle screen. 
* There are also settings to help maximize the use of your device's smaller screen by hiding items not relevant to you.

Look around in Preferences, there are a huge number of settings to personalize **Engine Driver**, including many more if you enable ``Show Advanced Preferences``.

   See the `Preferences <./preferences.html>`_ page for a full list of the available preferences.

The **Functions buttons** are changed via the ``Function Buttons`` menu option: :menuselection:`Menu --> Functions Buttons`

Some of the Function button preferences include:

* You can set the default labels and function numbers to display. 
* If you have entered labels for a roster entry in JMRI, these labels will be used for that entry, and can be copied from the dialog (access the menu after selecting a loco). 
* You can remove buttons by blanking out the labels.
