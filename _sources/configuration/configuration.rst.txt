|ed| is highly configurable.

Most of |EDs| configuration options are found in the :ref:`operation/interface:Preferences Screen` which is accessed via the overflow menu which is normally three dots (⁞) or three bars (≡).

While there are some preferences for configuring Functions in the :ref:`operation/interface:Preferences Screen`, most are found in three specific Function screens.

Similarly, configuring |EDs| |IPLS| feature is found on its own :ref:`operation/interface:in phone loco sounds screen`.

Preferences
============

  :scale: 40 %
  :align: right

Some of the *many* Preferences include:

* You can change the appearance and behaviour of the |T-S|
* You can turn off the :ref:`stop on release <configuration/preferences:stop on release?>` preference
* You can set a Maximum value and Maximum change% for the throttle sliders
* You can set the initial web page for the full-size web panel, or enable the smaller web view on the |T-S|
* There are also settings to help maximise the use of your device's smaller screen by hiding items not relevant to you

Look around in Preferences, there are a *huge number* of settings to personalise |ed|, including many more if you enable :ref:`Show Advanced Preferences <configuration/preferences:show advanced preferences?>` preference.

   See the :doc:`Preferences <./preferences>` page for a full list of the available preferences.

Configuring Functions
======================

The *Functions buttons* are changed via the :ref:`operation/interface:function defaults screen`, the :ref:`operation/interface:function latching settings screen` screen or the :ref:`operation/interface:DCC-EX Function Settings Screen` screen.  These are accessed from the menu.

Some of the Function button preferences include:

* You can set the default labels and function numbers to display. 
* If you have entered labels for a |ROSTER| entry in |JMRI| or |EX-CS|, these labels will be used for that entry, and can be copied from the dialog (access the menu after selecting a loco). 
* You can remove buttons by blanking out the labels.
