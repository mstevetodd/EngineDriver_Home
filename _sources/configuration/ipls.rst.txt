------------------------------------------------
Virtual Sounds / In Phone Loco Sounds (IPLS)
------------------------------------------------

Engine Driver can play locomotive sounds through your Android device/phones running Engine Driver or through a BlueTooth speaker connected to it.

To enable In Phone Loco Sounds (IPLS) select an option in ``Throttle 1 Loco Sounds`` or ``Throttle 2 Loco Sounds`` (or both).

To make it easy to switch sound profiles we recommend enabling the Status Bar button by setting the ``In phone sounds button`` preferences.

------------------
Custom IPLS Files
------------------

You can add custom IPLS files in the ``../Android/data/jmri.enginedriver/files/`` folder. They will appear in the list of profiles that can be selected in the ``Throttle 1 Loco Sounds`` or ``Throttle 2 Loco Sounds`` preferences.

    / sample custom 'In-Phone Loco Sounds' (.ipls) file
    /
    / - the first character of each line is the instruction/sound type
    / - Lines starting with "/" are comments
    / - Avoid additional spaces (it will try to trim leading and trailing spaces) 
    /   i.e don't put a space before or after the colon.
    / - this .ipls file MUST be placed in ../Android/data/jmri.enginedriver/files/
    / - By default, the sound files are expected to be in ../Android/data/jmri.enginedriver/files/
    /   however you can put them in subfolders by prepending the sound file name with <folder name><forward slash>  
    /   e.g. sample/bell_start.mp3     - will look for ../Android/jmri.enginedriver/files/sample/bell_start.mp3
    / - The files used for the inbuilt sounds can be copied from here: https://github.com/flash62au/EngineDriver/tree/master/EngineDriver/src/main/res/raw
    / - Sounds files can be .wav or .mp3 format.  Other formats may usable but are untested.
    / - Each sound is internally limited to one megabyte storage, which represents approximately 5.6 seconds at 44.1kHz stereo
