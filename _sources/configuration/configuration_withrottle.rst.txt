JMRI
^^^^

* Check your preferences/settings to insure you allow or disallow the control features desired. 
* If you've defined your turnouts/points and routes in a panel file, make sure to specify 'user names' for those you'd like to see listed on your throttle. 
* You can also 'filter' the turnouts shown using the WiThrottle->Filter Controls option in the WiThrottle window.
* Entering roster entries, and defining routes and turnouts on the server will all make your |ed| throttle more powerful and easier to use (though not required). 
* |ed| will show additional info if the JMRI Web Server is started (such as roster details and icon images).
