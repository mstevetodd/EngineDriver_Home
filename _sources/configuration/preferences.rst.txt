Localisation
""""""""""""

Changing the *Localisation* primarily changes the language used in the menus, buttons and messages throughout |ED|.

For English, it also changes the railroad/railway terminology (eg, Selecting 'Use Phone's global setting' and having this set to 'English (Australia)' or 'English (UK)' results in the term 'Points' to be displayed rather than 'Turnouts' as is displayed when 'English (US)' is selected). In the Preferences screen and the Throttle Screen Layout selection screen (where 'shunting' is displayed rather than 'switching').  This is not guaranteed to operate on all text on all screens. 

Supported localisations are:

* Use Phone's global setting |br| -  Will use any of the localisations below depending on what your system is set to it
* English (US) |br| - Engine Driver's default
* Italian
* Portuguese
* German
* Spanish
* Catalan
* French
* Czech

The following can't be chosen in the preference, but will be activated automatically if you select ``Use the Phone's global setting`` and you have selected one of the following primary languages in you Device's / Phone's global settings:

* English (UK)
* English (AUS)
* English (NZ)

Notes:

* The number is brackets after the Throttle Screen Layout name is the number of throttles that the layout can support.
* The 'Simple' Throttle Screen Layout is designed to allow for up to 6 throttles simultaneously.  |br|\ It is recommended that this only be used on a tablet device, because of the screen real estate demands that 6 throttles requires. |br|\ When this Throttle Screen Layout is selected, the ``Number of Throttles`` preferences options is activated.  You can then use this to restrict the number of throttles being displayed on the 'Simple' Throttle Screen Layout.  |br|\ Also the ``Functions Area Size`` preferences options is activated.  You can then use this to control how many Function Buttons are displayed with each throttle.  By default, not Function buttons will be shown. |br|\ If you have selected In Phone Loco Sounds, then you will want to set this to 4 (for Mute, Light, Bell and Whistle/Horn).

|ed| automatically reload the throttle screen after closing the preferences screen.

The amount the speed changes on each press can be changed with the `Speed Button Change Amount`_ preference.  Note that this is independent of the `Speed Button Change Amount (Volume)`_ preference and the `Speed Button Change Amount (Gamepad)`_ preference.

Holding down a button will increase / decrease the speed continuously by the preset amount, in series of steps.

The time between steps can be changed with the `Speed Button Repeat Delay`_ preference.  Note that this is independent of the `Speed Button Repeat Delay (Gamepad)`_ preference.  But the Volume button repeat Delay is linked to it.

Consist Function Follow Preferences
-----------------------------------

|todo|

Options for how functions will behave in a consist.

Consist Functions - Follow Rule Style
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

|todo|

Which style of rules to follow in a consist when function buttons are pressed.

Note: If 'Use Default function labels' is enabled, 'Special...' will also apply to the lead (or only) loco.


You can now arrange the labels on ED any way you want, and as long as the equivalent function has a similar name it doesn't matter what function number it is, it will activate it correctly.

I have added two new options to the menu " Special Exact" and "Special Partial"
These options override the Original and Complex options completely and ignore the string matching preferences (it disables them)

Their behaviour is:

* for every loco in the consist
  
  * for every function in the locos roster entries

    * if the string of the function label exactly matches (or partially matches) the label of the function the ED is currently showing for the pressed function button

      * the function will be activated on that loco
  
Note

* There is no lead trail checking.  any matching function will be activated in any loco
* If no matching function on a particular loco (including the lead) nothing will happen for that loco
* It will use the ED default function labels if you have set them
* OR whatever labels have been loaded for the lead loco.
* Partial patching is a bit so-so.  I have a couple of sound decoders that allow me to change the bell and whistle tones in the function buttons.  Those functions also get activated when I just press 'Bell' or 'Whistle' as that text was also in the labels for the functions..
