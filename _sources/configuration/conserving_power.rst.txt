|todo|

if you  Android device/phone runs out of power too quickly you can try the folowing things to help conserve power:

* Keep the brightness of the device as low as practical
* Disable Bluetooth and NFC if you are not using them
* You can also
  
  * Set the preference to dim screen on swipe up (or don). |br| If you are not using the throttle temporarily (i.e the train does not need any control for a little while), dim the screen until you need it back.
  * Set the preference to dim screen on shake. |br| If you are not using the throttle temporarily (i.e the train does not need any control for a little while), dim the screen until you need it back.
  * If your device has an AMOLED display, theoretically, the High Contrast Outline theme should use less power (though this is unproven).
