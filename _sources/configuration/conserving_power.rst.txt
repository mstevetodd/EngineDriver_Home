If your Android device/phone runs out of battery too quickly you can try the folowing to help conserve power:

* Keep the brightness of the device as low as practical
* Disable Bluetooth and NFC if you are not using them
* You can also:
  
  * Set the preference to :ref:`dim screen on Shake<configuration/preferences:accelerometer (shake) preferences>` or :ref:`dim screen on Swipe Up/Down<configuration/preferences:swipe up-down preferences>`. |br| If you are not using the throttle temporarily (i.e the train does not need any control for a little while), dim the screen until you need it back.
  * If your device has an AMOLED display, theoretically, the High Contrast Outline theme should use less power (though this is unproven).
