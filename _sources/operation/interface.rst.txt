The user interface for |ED| is described and explained in these pages as 'screens'.  There are several '`Main Screens`_' which you will routinely interact with and and larger number of '`Secondary / Support Screens`_' that will interact with infrequently. 

There are also some settings that impact all of the screens which described towards the end of this page:

* Theme
* Localisation 


Main Screens
-------------

There are four main screens:

* `Connection Screen`_
* `Throttle Screen`_
* `Turnouts/Points Screen`_
* `Routes Screen`_

----

Connection Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../_static/images/screenshots/connect.png
   :align: right

This screen is the first screen you normally see when starting |ED|. 

It allows you choose which |WTS| to connect to, which you must do to control your trains.

There are three ways you can select a |WTS| to connect to:

* IP Address and Port
* Discovered Servers
* Recent servers

Once you select a server the |T-S| will be automatically displayed.

If you only ever connect to one |WTS| you can effectively bypass this screen by enabling the `Auto-Connect to WiThrottle Server? <../configuration/preferences.html#auto-connect-to-withrottle-server>`_ preference.

.. note:: 
  :class: note-ed-hidden-title

  See :doc:`wifi_issues` for more assistance with connection difficulties.

Connection Method Options
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

IP Address and Port
'''''''''''''''''''

  Enter the IP address or URI of the server in the first field, and the port in the second field, then click :guilabel:`Connect`. |ed| will attempt to connect to it, and the |T-S| will be displayed.

Discovered Servers
''''''''''''''''''

  This is the most common way to connect.

  Your |WTS| will attempt to broadcast its details so that apps like |ED| can automatically find it.  If |ED| does find it, it will be listed here.

  To connect to any |WTS| in this list, simply click on the row.  |ed| will attempt to connect to it, and the |T-S| will be displayed.

Recent servers
''''''''''''''

  To connect to any |WTS| in this list, simply click on the row.  |ed| will attempt to connect to it.  If successful the |T-S| will be displayed.

  Note that, just because it is in this list, it does not mean that you can connect to it now. It only means that you have successfully connected to it in the past.

Action Bar (Connection Screen)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Action Bar appears at the top of all screens. It will show different information and different buttons depending on a\) the particular screen and b\) preferences you have set.

In the |C-S| the Action Bar only displays:

* The app name (|ed|)

See the `Action Bar`_ section of this page for more information.

Overflow Menu (Connection Screen)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The *Overflow Menu* (or simply '*Menu*') appears in the Action Bar at the top of most of the `main screens <../operation/interface.html#main-screens>`_ is normally three dots (⁞) or three bars (≡).
It will show different options depending on a) the particular screen, b) preferences you have set and c) the state of certain elements in the app.

Specific to the |C-S|, the Overflow Menu can display:

* `Preferences <../configuration/preferences.html>`_
* `View Log <../operation/interface.html#view-log-screen>`_
* `Exit <../operation/operation.html#exiting-engine-driver>`_
* `About <../operation/interface.html#about-screen>`_

.. note:: 
   :class: note-ed-hidden-title

   See the `Overflow Menu`_  section for more information.

Throttle Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../_static/images/screenshots/throttle_vertical_outline.png
   :scale: 8 %
   :align: right

The |T-S| has two distinct areas:

* The Action Bar
* One or more Throttle Areas

There are also some settings that impact the whole |T-S| which described towards the end of this section:

* Background
* Immersive Mode (Full Screen)
* Swipe Up / Down
* Accelerometer (Shake)  
 
The |T-S| allows you to control:

- Access common functions from the Action Bar and Menu
- Control one or more locos

The |T-S| contains between 1 and 6 Throttle areas depending on the Throttle layout chosen and the number of throttles for that layout (only some allow this to be changed).  


Throttle Area
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Each Throttle on the |T-S| will display different information and buttons depending on the ``Throttle Screen Layout`` in the  `Throttle Screen Layout <../configuration/preferences.html#throttle-screen-layout>`_ preference.

Each *Throttle Area* allows you to:

* Select and release locos 
* Control the speed and direction of your trains
* Activate DCC decoder functions like the light, bell, horn 
* Activate Virtual (IPLS) Sounds (bell, horn, short horn) (if enabled)

Loco Select Button
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The loco :guilabel:`Select` button in the Throttle Area allows to select or release locos for that particular Throttle.  Click on the button and you will be taken to the Select Loco screen.

   Once you have selected a loco, the label on the button change to the DCC Address(s) or the Roster name(s) of the Loco depending on how you select the loco in the |LS-S|, and if you have the enabled the `Loco Address instead of Name? <../preferences.html#loco-address-instead-of-name>`_ preference.

   When the button is displaying DCC Address(s) or the Roster name(s), click on the button again and you will be taken to the Select Loco screen where you can de-select the loco(s), select additional locos to make a consist / multiple unit train, edit the locos in the consist, or edit the lights of the locos in the consist / multiple unit.

   .. note:: 
      :class: note-ed-hidden-title

      See the `Operation <../operation/index.html#selecting-releasing-locos>`_ page for more information.

Speed indicator
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The *Speed Indicator* or *Speed* area of each throttle of the |T-S| indicates the throttle amount/setting (rather than the actual speed of the locos controlled by the the throttle).
   
   Depending on the `Speed Units Preference <../configuration/preferences.html#speed-units>`_ the upper value show will be different: 

   .. list-table::
    :width: 100%
    :widths: 60 20 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Speed Unit Setting
      - Low value
      - High Value
    * - Percent 0 - 100% 
      - 0
      - 100
    * - Auto Speed steps 
      - ?
      - ?
    * - 8 steps 
      - 0
      - 8
    * - 10 steps 
      - 0
      - 10
    * - 14 steps 
      - 0
      - 14
    * - 28 steps 
      - 0
      - 28
    * - 128 steps
      - 0
      - 128

   Also, if one of the Shunting/Switching layouts is selected, the high number will be negative ('-') when reversed (e.g. -100 - 0 - 100)

   The *Speed Indicator* area also can show:

   * Volume indicator
   * Gamepad Indicator
   * Direction indicator (Shunting/Switching Layouts only)

   *Volume Indicator*

   A 'V' will be shown in the *Speed Indicator* area to indicate which throttle is being controlled by the hardware volume buttons.
   Touch another *Speed Indicator* to change which Throttle the Hardware Volume buttons control.

   *Gamepad Indicator*
   
   A number ('1','2', etc.) will be shown in the *Speed Indicator* area to indicate which throttle is being controlled by the each connected gamepad.  Set one of the gamepad to allow you to switch throttle it controls.

   *Direction Indicator*

   If one of the Shunting/Switching layouts is selected, a triangle symbol will be shown to indicate direction (pointing Up for forward, and down for reverse).

   .. note:: 
      :class: note-ed-hidden-title

      See the Throttle Control Preferences section of the `Speed Units preference <../configuration/preferences.html#speed-units>`_ for a information on changing the ``Speed Units`` options.

Speed Slider Area
'''''''''''''''''
   .. image:: ../_static/images/parts/slider_horizontal.png
      :scale: 100 %

   The Throttle areas can be configured with a *Speed Slider*.  (All Throttle Screen layouts except the 'Big Button' layouts include sliders by default.) Dragging you finger along the slider will increase or decrease the speed of the loco(s) selected for the that Throttle. Pressing and holding your finger at one spot on the slider will cause |ED| to slowly increase or decrease the speed of the loco(s) selected for that Throttle till it gets to that point.
   
   Depending on the ``Throttle Screen Layout`` chosen in the  `Throttle Screen Layout <../configuration/preferences.html#throttle-screen-layout>`_ preference, all sliders on the |T-S| will be either:
   
   * one-directional (0% - 100%) [#PCT]_  |br|\ or 
   * bi-directional (-100% - 0 - +100%) |br| |br|

   Bi-directional sliders are useful for when you are switching/shunting. i.e. moving your locos backwards and forwards a lot.

   Several preferences can change the appearance or actions of the *Speed Slider*\:

   * `Increase Slider/Speed Height? <../configuration/preferences.html#increase-slider-speed-height>`_ |br| When set, this preference will show a taller Slider, or Speed buttons, for throttles
   * `Throttle Speed Slider Margin <../configuration/preferences.html#throttle-speed-slider-margin>`_ |br| When set, this changes the space between either the edge of the screen and the ends of the Slider, or if the Speed Buttons are enabled, the edge of the Speed Buttons and the ends of the Slider. Specific in pixels haw far to offset
   * `Hide Speed Slider? <../configuration/preferences.html#hide-speed-slider>`_ |br| When this preferences is set, |ed| will not show speed slider, use speed buttons instead
   * `Tick Marks on Speed Sliders? <../configuration/preferences.html#tick-marks-on-speed-sliders>`_ |br| When this preferences is set, |ED| will show tick marks on the background of the Speed Sliders
   * `Switching throttle Dead Zone <../configuration/preferences.html#switching-throttle-dead-zone>`_ |br| When this preferences is set, |ED| will set the size of the dead zone, or detent, on the slider of the Switching/Shunting |T-S|
   * `Stop Button Vertical Margins <../configuration/preferences.html#stop-button-vertical-margins>`_ |br| When this preferences is set, |ED| will add the entered number of pixels to offset margins of the stop button from the speed buttons and bottom of screen

    .. [#PCT] The actual amounts shown in the *Speed Indicator* will depend on the ``Speed Units`` chosen in the  `Speed Units preference <../configuration/preferences.html#speed-units>`_.

Stop Button

   .. image:: ../_static/images/parts/stop_button_horizontal.png
      :scale: 80 %

  Clicking the ``Stop`` button of a throttle will the loco or consists / multiple unit controlled by that throttle.  If the locos have momentum configured in the decoded it/they will slow then stop. 

   .. note:: 
      :class: note-ed-hidden-title

      See the `Emergeny Stop Action Bar button <emergency stop button>`_ for information on stopping locos immediately, overriding the momentum setting.

Speed Buttons
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   .. image:: ../_static/images/parts/speed_buttons_horizontal.png
      :scale: 100 %

   The Throttles may optionally be configured have simple buttons that allow you to increase or decrease the loco's speed in pre-defined steps. The buttons are displayed at either end of the *speed sliders*.
   
   When enabled:
   
   * the :guilabel:`++` will **increase** the throttle speed by the `Speed Button Change Amount <../configuration/preferences.html#speed-button-change-amount>`_.
   * the :guilabel:`--` will **decrease** the throttle speed by the `Speed Button Change Amount <../configuration/preferences.html#speed-button-change-amount>`_.

   For the Horizontal Sliders only, The position of these buttons in relation to the speed sliders (the space between), can be altered with the :ref:`Speed Slider Margin <configuration/preferences:throttle speed slider margin>` preference.

Function Buttons Scroll Area
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   The *Function Buttons Scroll Area* will show form 0 (zero) to 26 function buttons depending on a number of factors. Each button will show either:

   * Labels provided from the roster, which can be individually specified for each loco in the roster
   * The default labels for |ed|  (which can be changed)

   The *Function Button area* can also show:

   * IPLS buttons  (In Phone Loco Sounds)
   * Pause
   * Limit Speed

   The *Function Buttons Scroll Area* is shown by default on all Throttle Screen layouts except ``Simple``.  It can be enable fot the ``Simple`` layout

   .. note:: 
     :class: note-ed-hidden-title

     See the :ref:`Function Button Area Size <configuration/preferences:function buttons area size>` preference for information on how to show the *Function Button Scroll Area* on the simple layout.

DCC Function buttons
''''''''''''''''''''

.. todo DCC Function buttons

DCC Function Buttons are displayed here.  If there are too many to display in the screen area allocated, then the area becomes scrollable (without scroll bars) so that they can all be viewed and pressed as needed.  

All throttle layouts other than the 'Simple' layout show a *Function Buttons Scroll Area* by default.  For the 'Simple' layout it must be enable in the preferences if required.

Will show from 0 (zero) to 26 DCC function buttons, depending on a number of factors. Each button will show either:

* Labels provided from the roster, which can be individually specified for each loco in the roster
* The default labels for |ed|  (which can be changed)


If the loco (or first loco of a consist/multiple unit) was selected from the |WTS| roster, then (by default) the number of functions and labels on the buttons will be whatever is configured for that loco in the |WTS|.  This is also trun if the loco is selected from the Recent Locos list or the Recent Consist/Multiple Units list.

If the loco (or first loco of a consist/multiple unit) was added by entering its DCC Address, then the number of functions and labels on the buttons will be whatever is configured in |ED| in the |FD-S|.

The behaviour of the Function Buttons for locos selected from the |WTS| roster can be overridden with the :ref:`Use default function labels? <configuration/preferences:use default function labels?>` preference.  If this is enabled, the locos selected from the |WTS| roster will also show the Default Functions labels.

Clicking on any function button will instruct the loco to activate that DCC Function in the loco.  By default this is only sent to the Lead loco, however this can be overridden in a number of differnt ways.

.. note:: 
  :class: note-ed-hidden-title

  See the `Function Defaults Screen <Function Defaults Screen>`_ section for more information on configuring the labels and number of *default function* buttons.

The 'filter' then allows you to select one of those locations and |ed| can just show the Routes at the 'Location'.

The `Location Delimiter <../configuration/preferences.html#location-delimiter>`_ preference allows you to set the character that marks the end of the Location portion of Turnout/Point and Route names.  By default it is a colon (":") but any character can be used.
