|jedt|, more commonly known as |ed|, is a free Android application that connects to a WiThrottleâ„¢ [#WIT]_ Server to control model trains.

Supported servers include `JMRI <https://jmri.org/>`_, `DCC-EX <https://dcc-ex.com/>`_, `MRC Prodigy WiFi <https://www.modelrectifier.com/category-s/332.htm>`_, `Digitrax LnWi <https://www.digitrax.com/products/wireless/lnwi/>`_, and `WifiTrax (for NCE) <http://wifitrax.com/products/product-WFD-30-detail.html>`_. 
Once connected, you can control the speed direction and up to 29 DCC functions of your DCC enabled locomotives (locos). From one to six locos or consists / multiple units can e controlled at the same time.  
You can easily create and edit on-the-fly consists / multiple units (software-defined). 
You can also control layout power, turnouts/points, routes, and access JMRI web panels and windows.

Why Use Engine Driver
---------------------

You can use |ed| to operate your DCC model train layout without being physically tethered by any wires. This allows you to walk around your layout, following your trains and/or position yourself anywhere around your layout (e.g. at your favourite viewing position).

You can add additional |ed| controllers inexpensively using old Android phones or tablets, instead of proprietary controllers.  (You don't need to have a sim card in the phone.)

You only need to interact with JMRI and/or your DCC command station directly when setting up or re-configuring your layout. Once configured, you do not need to interact with either JMRI or your DCC command station directly while you are running your trains.
