Why Use Engine Driver
---------------------

You can use **Engine Driver** to operate your DCC model train layout without being physically tethered by any wires. This allows you to walk around your layout, following your trains and/or position yourself anywhere around your layout (e.g. at your favourite viewing position).

You can add additional **Engine Driver** controllers inexpensively using old Android phones or tablets, instead of proprietary controllers.  (You don't need to have a sim card in the phone.)

You only need to interact with JMRI and/or your DCC command station directly when setting up or re-configuring your layout. Once configured, you do not need to interact with either JMRI or your DCC command station directly while you are running your trains.
