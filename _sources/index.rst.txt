Supported servers include `JMRI <https://jmri.org/>`_, `DCC-EX <https://dcc-ex.com/>`_, `MRC Prodigy WiFi <https://www.modelrectifier.com/category-s/332.htm>`_, `Digitrax LnWi <https://www.digitrax.com/products/wireless/lnwi/>`_, and `WifiTrax (for NCE) <http://wifitrax.com/products/product-WFD-30-detail.html>`_. 
Once connected, you can control your locomotives (locos) and your entire model railroad. 
Speed, direction, and up to 29 DCC functions are supported for one to six locomotives or consists / multiple units. 
You can create and edit consists / multiple units (software-defined). 
You can also control layout power, turnouts/points, routes, and access JMRI web panels and windows.

See `About <./about/index.html>`_ for more information.

See `Operation <./operation/index.html>`_ for details on how to use **Engine Driver**.

Why Use Engine Driver
---------------------

You can use **Engine Driver** to operate your DCC model railway without being physically tethered by any wires. This allows you to walk around your layout, following your trains and/or position yourself anywhere around your layout (e.g. at your favourite viewing position).

Adding a **Engine Driver** controller is inexpensive. Instead of an expensive DCC controller, most old Android phones or tablet will work.  You don't need to have a sim card in the phone.

You only need to interact with JMRI and/or your DCC command station directly when setting up or re-configuring your layout. Once configured, you do not need to interact with either JMRI or your DCC command station directly while you are running your trains.
